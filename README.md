## STRATEGY


## STARTING THE GAME AS FIRST

Put your checker in the center column if you're first.

Because a checker in the center column allows you to make a 
Connect 4 in all possible directions, this is the best possible first move.


## STARTING THE GAME AS SECOND  

Play your checker on top of your opponent's if you're second.

By putting your checker on top of your opponent's checker in the same column, 
you can guarantee at least a draw.

This strategy works best if your opponent drops their first checker in the center column.
If they put it somewhere else, take the center column to gain the upper hand.
